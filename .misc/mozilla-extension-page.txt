A sidebar based RSS feed reader like the good ol' Sage add-on, may the gods avenge his untimely death.


+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS, JSON and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I did my best to keep it lightweight and fast.

&emsp;&emsp;Pinterest and Behance.

&emsp;● Feeds automatically sync across your devices when using Firefox Sync.
&emsp;● Fully customizable tree view. Add/Edit/Delete/Copy/Paste/Drag-n-drop directly
&emsp;&emsp;in sidebar.

&emsp;● Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.

&emsp;&emsp;style sheet).
