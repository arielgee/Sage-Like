  <li>Feed discovery from the sidebar and from the address bar.</li>
  <li>Integrated with the browser's native bookmarks.</li>
  <li>Fully customizable tree view. Add, edit & delete feeds and folders directly from the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Diversified filtering capabilities to the tree feeds.</li>
  <li>Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.</li>
  <li>Support for <i>Middle Click</i>, <i>Ctrl+Click</i> & <i>Shift+Click</i> in the feed-items list.</li>
  <li>Feed preview (via: feed → context menu → Open xxx).</li>
  <li>Support for import & export feed subscriptions using an OPML file.</li>
  <li>Customizable UI font & colors.</li>
</ul>
