  <li>A sidebar based display.</li>
  <li>Feed discovery from the sidebar and from the address bar.</li>
  <li>Integrated with the browser's native bookmarks.</li>
  <li>Fully customizable tree view. Add, edit & delete feeds and folders directly from the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Filtering capabilities to the feeds tree.</li>
  <li>Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.</li>
  <li>Feed preview (via: feed → context menu → Open xxx).</li>

</ul>
