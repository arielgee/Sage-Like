--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I tried to keep it lightweight and fast.

Since Firefox 64 the built-in support for RSS feeds was dropped (thanks Mozilla!). I'll provide a solution for this feature as soon as possible.
