--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS, JSON and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I tried to keep it lightweight and fast.

◼ <b>Features</b>

&emsp;● A sidebar based display.
&emsp;● Feed discovery from the sidebar and from the address bar.
&emsp;● Integrated with the browser's native bookmarks.
&emsp;● Fully customizable tree view. Add/Edit/Delete/Drag-n-drop directly from sidebar.
&emsp;● Various filtering capabilities to the tree feeds (filter by title, URL or status).
&emsp;● Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.
&emsp;● Support for <i>middle-click</i>, <i>ctrl-click</i> & <i>shift-click</i> in the feed-items list.
&emsp;● Rendered Feed Preview via <i>middle-click</i> or context menu (support custom style sheet).
&emsp;● Support for import & export feed subscriptions using an OPML file.
&emsp;● Customizable UI font & colors.
