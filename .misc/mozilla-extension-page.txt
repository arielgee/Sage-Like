+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS, JSON and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I did my best to keep it lightweight and fast.

&emsp;● Feed discovery from the sidebar and from the address bar.

&emsp;&emsp;Pinterest and Behance.
&emsp;● Integrated with the browser's native bookmarks.
&emsp;● Feeds automatically sync across your devices when using Firefox Sync.
&emsp;● Fully customizable tree view. Add/Edit/Delete/Copy/Paste/Drag-n-drop directly
&emsp;&emsp;in the sidebar.
&emsp;● Various filtering capabilities to the tree feeds (filter by title, URL or status).
&emsp;● Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.
