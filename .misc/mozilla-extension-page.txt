A basic RSS reader like the good ol' Sage add-on, may the gods avenge his untimely death.


+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS, JSON and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I did my best to keep it lightweight and fast.

◼ <b>FEATURES</b>

&emsp;● Feed discovery from the sidebar and from the address bar.
&emsp;● Customized discovery of "hidden" RSS feeds on YouTube, Reddit, DeviantArt,
&emsp;&emsp;Pinterest and Behance.
&emsp;● Integrated with the browser's native bookmarks.
&emsp;● Feeds automatically sync across your devices when using Firefox Sync.
&emsp;● Fully customizable tree view. Add/Edit/Delete/Copy/Paste/Drag-n-drop directly
&emsp;&emsp;in sidebar.
&emsp;● Various filtering capabilities to the tree feeds (filter by title, URL or status).
&emsp;● Context menus for feeds and for feed-items (articles) offer more actions.
&emsp;● Support for <i>middle-click</i>, <i>ctrl-click</i> & <i>shift-click</i> in the feed-items list.
&emsp;● Rendered Feed Preview via <i>middle-click</i> or context menu (support custom
&emsp;&emsp;style sheet).
&emsp;● Support for import & export feed subscriptions using an OPML file.
&emsp;● Customizable UI font & colors.

<b>About the Next Version</b>
If no new issues are discovered, this version will be the last one to support Firefox 59.

My intention for the next released version is to implement support for Manifest V3. This migration from Manifest V2 to V3 will require raising the minimum supported browser version to Firefox 109.

To put it simply, if you are using Firefox 109 or higher, you will be able to receive the upcoming version from Mozilla Add-ons, which will include various improvements resulting from the discontinuation of support for older Firefox versions.

<b>Changes</b>
<ul>
  <li>Added custom feed discovery for Reddit, DeviantArt, Pinterest and Behance.</li>
  <li>Added to context menu item 'Try to Open…' the ability to handle selected text as a link.</li>
