--------------------------------------------------------------
A basic RSS reader like the good ol' Sage add-on, may the gods avenge his untimely death.


+ Product Page Description (About this extension)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sage-Like is a simple, sidebar based feed reader (Atom, RSS, JSON and RDF). Like its add-on predecessors, Sage by Peter Andrews and the Sage++ by Higmmer, I did my best to keep it lightweight and fast.

&emsp;&emsp;in sidebar.
&emsp;● Various filtering capabilities to the tree feeds (filter by title, URL or status).
